Create an app (front and back) for different types of notifications and different channels. Must be scalable.

# HOW TO RUN THE APP

1. (optional. Without this step, the default values will be used) Create a .env file on the directory root with the pattern:
   ENVIRONMENT: <<default: development>>
   MONGO_DB_PORT: <<default: 27017>>
2. Run the command (on the root): > docker-compose up
